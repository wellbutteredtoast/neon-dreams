#### CORE DETAILS ####
Language: C++ (Core) | Ruby (Scripting)
Renderer: SDL
ScriptRT: MRuby
DataFmts: JSON (items, npcs, quests)
          YAML (save data)
          TEXT (logging, dumps, etc)

BuildSys: CMake
AudioSys: SDL_Mixer
DbgTools: CLI tools + ImGui tools
Modding?: Ruby!

#### TOOLS ####
Item Editor:        CLI
NPC Editor:         CLI
Debug Save Creator: CLI
Save Editor:        CLI
Map Editor:         GUI
Quest Editor:       CLI
Item Packager:      CLI
NPC Packager:       CLI
Save Validator:     CLI

#### CUSTOM FILE ASSOCS ####
Map Files:      *._scene
Save Files:     *.save
Backup Save:    *.save.backup
Save Checksum:  *.save.key
Backup Key:     *.save.backup.key

* 'key' == SHA512 checksum
*       == or MD5

#### LOG LEVELS ####
[SYSTEM]:   >> Verbose logs, usually in debug builds.
[INFO]:     >> Typical surface-level stuff.
[WARNING]:  >> Somethings wrong, but nothing bad.
[ERROR]:    >> Bad things, but no crashes yet.
[CRITICAL]: >> And *now* things are crashing.

#### JSON ####
All things written in JSON will be stored in very lightly
encrypted JSON, XOR with a small key that's easy to find.

This means all item and NPC data will be packaged into JSON,
and then the JSON will get XOR'd and have a key produced for
later validation.

#### YAML ####
The same above applies to YAML, the data will be XOR'd with
a fairly typical key, but also checksum'd afterwards to ensure
validity.

#### VERSION CONTROLS ####
Git, long live GitHub! All game code and assets are in a private
GitHub repo, where also all issues will be documented for the
sake of archiving.
