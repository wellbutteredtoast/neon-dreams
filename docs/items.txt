#### ITEMS ####
Items are objects the player interacts with. Fairly standard stuff. All items
exist as lightly secured JSON files with the *.item extension. For simplicity,
all items follow the following simple schema;

{
    "item_id": {
        "name": "",
        "desc": "",
        "type": "",
        "attributes": [
            ...
        ]
    }
}

Everything is pretty easy to gather, each item has a unique ID, a name, a very
interesting description, what item type it is, and then the one that needs more
explaining, 'attributes'. Attributes are just plain text strings of words and
stuff that the game understands, and will apply any and all attrs it can find
to whatever item its parsing. As of now, there is no real limit to how many
attrs an item can have, and you can even make conflicting attributes. But at
the end of the day, it's a fairly basic system. Further down in this document
you can find a master list of all attributes (AKA: once things are finalized).
